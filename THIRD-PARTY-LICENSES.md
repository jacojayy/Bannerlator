# Third-Party Licenses & Attribution

**Bannerlator** is a derivative work distributed as a whole under the **GNU General Public License, version 3** (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)).

It incorporates the third-party works listed below. **Each retains its own copyright and license**, reproduced or summarised here as required by those licenses. The combined work is licensed under **GPL-3.0** because it incorporates GPL-3.0-licensed components (notably **GameNative** and **lsfg-vk**); every other license listed here (MIT, LGPL-2.1/3.0, Zlib, BSD, Apache-2.0, CC0) is compatible with, and may be combined into, a GPL-3.0 work.

> **Why this file exists.** The upstream Winlator lineage this project descends from is **MIT © 2023 BrunoSX** (preserved in full below, as MIT requires). Bannerlator additionally incorporates GPL-3.0 code, so the *combined* distribution is GPL-3.0. This document reconciles both and records every author's notice.

GitHub-detected licenses were verified on **2026-07-07**. Licenses marked *"per upstream"* are the well-known licenses of those projects, stated from their upstream repositories rather than re-verified here.

## 1. Foundation — the Winlator / Star lineage (MIT © 2023 BrunoSX)

This codebase descends directly from the following, all of which carry the **same MIT license, `Copyright (c) 2023 BrunoSX`**:

| Project | Author | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Winlator](https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator) — Wine + Box64 + Turnip on Android (the foundation) | **brunodev85** (BrunoSX) | MIT © 2023 BrunoSX ¹ |
| [Winlator `cmod`](https://github.com/coffincolors/winlator) — `com.winlator.cmod` customization layer | **coffincolors** | MIT © 2023 BrunoSX |
| [Winlator Bionic](https://github.com/Pipetto-crypto/winlator) — the "Bionic" half of Star Bionic | **Pipetto-crypto** | MIT © 2023 BrunoSX |
| [Star](https://github.com/jacojayy/star) — the Star Bionic line this build continues | **jacojayy** / star-emu | MIT © 2023 BrunoSX |
| [Winlator-Ludashi](https://github.com/StevenMXZ/Winlator-Ludashi) — the Compose UI + Vulkan renderer path cherry-picked here | **StevenMXZ** | MIT © 2023 BrunoSX |
| [`input_controls`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunodev85/winlator/main/input_controls/) profiles | **brunodev85** | MIT (part of Winlator) |

¹ *brunodev85's own repository has since been **relicensed to LGPL-2.1**. That relicensing does not retroactively affect the MIT-licensed code that the forks above (and therefore this project) took during the MIT era; an MIT grant, once given, is irrevocable for the code it was granted on.*

The full text of that MIT license, preserved verbatim:
