/**
 * Scrubs credentials out of a log line before it is written somewhere a user will share.
 *
 * The Steam client's own logs are the reason this exists: they carry the account's session token
 * (logged as a bare number after "Using JWT"), machine-auth GUIDs, `token=`/`sessionid=` pairs,
 * Steam Guard codes, 32-hex WebAPI keys and the account's SteamID. A session folder from this app
 * is meant to be attached to a bug report as it is, so none of that may be in it.
 *
 * Same scrubber as the SteamDeck standalone app (The412Banner/SteamDeck, LogRedactor.kt), kept in
 * step with it so a bundle from either app is safe to attach as it is.
 *
 * What is deliberately KEPT, because it is what makes a log worth reading: EResult codes, CM host
 * names and IP addresses, timings, token expiry dates, app IDs, pids, connection-state changes and
 * file paths. A SteamID is masked rather than deleted - first four and last four digits survive -
 * so a reader can still tell two accounts' lines apart without the value identifying either.
