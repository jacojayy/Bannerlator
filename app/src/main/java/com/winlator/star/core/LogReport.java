/**
 * Builds a bug report out of one game's logs: a redacted zip the user can attach, plus the issue
 * body text that goes with it.
 *
 * Why this is two steps rather than one. GitHub has no API for attaching a file to an issue — the
 * only upload path is the web UI's own, tied to a signed-in session. A URL can prefill the title
 * and body and nothing else. So the app writes the zip somewhere the browser's file picker can
 * reach, prefills everything it knows, and the attach itself is one tap in the GitHub form.
 *
 * Everything in the zip goes through {@link LogcatCapture#redact}, line by line. Be precise about
 * what that buys, because this bundle is destined for a PUBLIC tracker and the wording we show the
 * user has to match the code: it strips e-mail addresses, token-shaped blobs, SteamID64s and any
 * secret {@code SteamRepository} registered — which is the signed-in account name and refresh
 * token, and nothing when no one has signed in. It does NOT strip a person's name out of a file
 * path, and deliberately so; paths are usually what makes a log diagnosable. The user-facing note
 * this class emits says exactly that rather than promising "usernames" wholesale.
 *
 * What goes IN the zip is decided by {@link LogInventory#filesIn}, which is allowlist-driven. It
 * must stay that way: the log root can be a folder the user chose, full of files that are none of
 * our business.
