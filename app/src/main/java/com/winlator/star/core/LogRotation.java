/**

 * The current run's files keep their plain names — {@code wine_debug.log}, {@code <game>_d3d11.log} —
 * so "the latest log" is always the obvious file, and anyone who already knows where
 * {@code wine_debug.log} lives still finds it. At the START of a launch the previous run's files are
 * moved into {@code previous/<timestamp>/} and the oldest archives beyond the keep-count are deleted.
 *
 * Rotating on launch rather than on exit is deliberate: a crashed or force-killed game never gets to
 * run exit code, and that is exactly the run whose log matters most.
 *
 * Only files we can attribute to a run are moved — the sweep is shallow, so it never touches the
 * {@code previous/} folder itself or anything a user dropped in there.
