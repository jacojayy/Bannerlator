/**
 * The handheld's companion screen while a game plays on the TV ("Launch this game on the TV" — see
 * [ExternalDisplay]). It says what is happening, asks the user not to touch the handheld, and gives
 * them the two things they may still need: put input back on the TV, and end the game.
 *
 * Why it exists: Android keeps exactly ONE focused display, and the physical controller follows it.
 * With the game on the TV the handheld was left showing the games list, so a stray touch there moved
 * focus to the handheld and the pad stopped reaching the game — device-proven with `input -d <id> tap`,
 * which moves `mTopFocusedDisplayId` to the display it taps. A games list cannot tell the user any of
 * that, so this screen stands in its place and says it.
 *
 * Why it cannot steal focus itself — two independent reasons, both deliberate:
 * - it is started BEFORE the session, from `launchOnExternalDisplay`, so the session on the TV is the
 *   last activity started and is the one that ends up focused;
 * - its window carries FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE, so it never becomes a display's focused window and touching
 *   it cannot hand the handheld the top focus either. Touch events still reach the buttons (only
 *   FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE would stop those), which is why nothing here is controller-operated: the pad
 *   belongs to the TV.
 *
 * Lifetime: started by the launch path, dismissed by the SESSION's own lifecycle
 * (XServerDisplayActivity: a declined TV launch, the TV going away, exit, destroy) rather than by
 * anyone guessing from out here. [show] arms a watchdog as the one backstop for a session that never
 * arrives at all, so a failed launch can never leave a screen stuck on the handheld.
