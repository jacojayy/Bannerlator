/**
 * The "HDR output" setting of the Wayland backend — one place for everything the container editor,
 * the game-shortcut editor, XMB game settings and the launch path must agree on.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does.</b> On a screen that reports HDR10, a game that supports HDR gets it: the Wayland
 * compositor offers games HDR10 (wp_color_manager_v1 + 10-bit buffers) and puts their frames on their
 * own display layer tagged BT.2020 PQ (see {@code waylandcomp/src/banner_color.h}), and the session
 * exports {@code DXVK_HDR=1} so DXVK tells the game the display is HDR. The game still needs HDR
 * switched on in its own settings. Not the drawer's "HDR" screen effect (an SDR bloom filter).
 *
 * <p><b>Where it is stored.</b> {@link #EXTRA} in the container's extraData ("1" = on, absent = off) and
 * in a game shortcut's extras ("1" on, "0" off, absent / "" = the container's). The shortcut wins, the
 * same resolve the launch path uses ({@link #effective}). {@code BANNER_WAYLAND_HDR} in the container's
 * or shortcut's environment variables overrides both (1 / 0 / force) — kept for testing.
 *
 * <p><b>When it can be on.</b> Only where the screen the game runs on lists HDR10
 * ({@link #unavailableReason}); the editors grey the row out with the reason everywhere else, and the
 * launch path turns nothing on there even if the stored value says on.
 *
 * <p>Every method is safe to call from any thread and never throws.
