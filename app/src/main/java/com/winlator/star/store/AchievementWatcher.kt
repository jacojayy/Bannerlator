/**
 * Event-driven watcher for a running Steam game's Goldberg/GSE achievement store. When the emulator
 * writes an unlock into its `achievements.json`, this re-reads the file, diffs it against a snapshot
 * of what was already earned when the game launched, and for each NEWLY earned achievement fires the
 * in-game gold pill ([XServerDialogState.showAchievementToast]) and records it for later sync-back
 * ([SteamAchievementStore.queueUnlock]).
 *
 * The GSE store lives at, per the running container's Wine prefix:
 *   `<container>/.wine/drive_c/users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/GSE Saves/<appId>/achievements.json`
 * (gbe_fork's default, used by the Regular / Experimental / Cold Client Loader modes). We ALSO watch
 * the legacy Goldberg spelling `Goldberg SteamEmu Saves/<appId>/` as the cold-client userdata mirror,
 * so an older emulator build is covered too — whichever exists.
 *
 * Robustness: the achievements.json (and even its parent dirs) may not exist yet at launch — a game
 * only creates them once it first writes an unlock/config. So instead of watching a fixed path we arm
 * a FileObserver on the DEEPEST existing ancestor of each candidate file and RE-ARM one level deeper
 * as the missing directories appear, re-checking the file on every re-arm. All writes are debounced.
 *
 * Best-effort + fully guarded (logs to "BH_STEAM_ACHV"): nothing here may crash or block the game.
