/**
 * Steam Cloud (UFS) per-game save up/download manager.
 *
 * Mirrors the shape of [GogCloudSaveManager]: a stateless helper with two directional static-style
 * entry points ([downloadSaves] cloud -> local, [uploadSaves] local -> cloud) plus a [Callback].
 * Each op runs on its own background thread and reports progress via the callback.
 *
 * Uses JavaSteam's [SteamCloud] handler (obtained from [SteamRepository.getSteamCloud]) which speaks
 * the real Steam UFS protocol:
 *   - [SteamCloud.getAppFileListChange] -> the remote file manifest for an app
 *   - [SteamCloud.clientFileDownload]   -> a signed CDN URL to GET one cloud file
 *   - [SteamCloud.beginAppUploadBatch] / [SteamCloud.beginFileUpload] /
 *     [SteamCloud.commitFileUpload] / [SteamCloud.completeAppUploadBatch] -> the upload handshake
 *
 * SAFETY — cloud saves can never be deleted by this class. See [uploadSaves]: `filesToDelete` is
 * hard-wired to an empty list on every code path, and an empty local folder is refused before any
 * batch is opened. There is no code path that computes or sends a deletion to the cloud.
