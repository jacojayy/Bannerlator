/**
 * Update-on-launch for the RealSteam (SteamLite / VAC) launch path.
 *
 * ── Why ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Our lightweight SteamLite agent logs into real Steam and `LaunchApp`s the game, but — unlike the
 * genuine Steam client — it does NOT run Steam's pre-launch content update. So a game whose installed
 * files are an OLDER build than the current public build launches stale. Latest-only online titles
 * (device-observed: Brawlhalla 291550 → "INCORRECT VERSION — Restart Steam to get the latest version")
 * then block multiplayer. [ensureCurrentBuild] closes that gap: before a RealSteam launch it makes sure
 * the game is on the current public build, running the existing depot downloader (delta-only, in place)
 * when it isn't.
 *
 * ── Staleness detection ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no per-install build column in [SteamDatabase] (`markInstalled` records only is_installed /
 * install_dir / size_bytes, and `depot_manifests` is re-upserted from PICS on every library sync so it
 * tracks the LIVE target, not what's on disk). So we record the build we installed ourselves in a small
 * marker file ([BUILD_MARKER_REL]) inside the game's install dir — written both here after a successful
 * update AND by [SteamDepotDownloader] on every completed install (so normal store installs also stamp
 * their build and get the cheap compare going forward).
 *
 *   live build  = the selected branch's `buildid` in the `steam_branches` table (parsed from PICS at
 *                 library-sync / add time). Accessor: [SteamRepository.getBranches] → BranchRow.buildId.
 *   installed    = the branch|buildId recorded in the marker (absent for pre-feature installs → 0).
 *
 * Fast path (NO network): recorded build == live build AND the game is installed on disk → done(CURRENT)
 * with ~no delay. Otherwise (behind, or install/live build unknown) we run a delta update pass. A
 * pre-feature install with no marker (the device Brawlhalla case) has installedBuild==0, so it runs the
 * delta pass once, self-heals, and stamps the marker — every later launch is then the fast no-op.
 *
 * ── Robustness ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * We never hard-block a launch. If the live build can't be determined (no branch data) or Steam is
 * offline / the session can't be restored, we return [Result.OFFLINE_UNKNOWN] and let the caller offer
 * "launch anyway (stale)" vs. abort. A cheap session check up front keeps an offline launch snappy
 * instead of hanging behind the depot downloader's ~60s session-recovery retries.
 *
 * Only the RealSteam path uses this — Goldberg and Raw launches are untouched.
 *
 * ── Manual entry points (SteamLite roadmap #3) ───────────────────────────────
 * Update/verify are no longer run automatically before a launch. The launch-method popup drives them
 * as explicit user actions instead: [checkForUpdate] (cheap, non-downloading) feeds the popup's update
 * indicator; [updateNow] runs the delta update (an alias for [ensureCurrentBuild]); and [verifyFiles]
 * runs a real "verify integrity of game files" — it clears the resume state and re-validates EVERY
 * on-disk file against the live manifest regardless of the build compare.

     *     branch's manifests from the CM, so it pulls only the changed/missing chunks against the
     *     existing install dir.
     *  2. CORRUPT-INSTALL VERIFY — a previously-interrupted download can leave the game's files empty
     *     while the engine's on-disk resume state ([DEPOT_CONFIG_DIR]/depot.config) already records the
     *     depot at the live manifest. Its manifest-diff then sees "no changed files", fetches 0 bytes,
     *     and the completion guard correctly rejects the still-broken install ("incomplete … emptyFiles").
     *     A plain retry keeps trusting that state. On that specific failure we clear the resume state
     *     ONCE and re-run: with no recorded installed-manifest the engine re-validates EVERY on-disk
     *     file against the live manifest and re-downloads the empty/mismatched content (keeping the good
     *     files). This is the least-destructive re-fetch; the false-complete guard is left intact.
