/**
 * The storefront's read-only catalog client: the three Store-tab rails and the priced search list.
 *
 * Two of Steam's **undocumented** public store endpoints back this:
 *  - `store.steampowered.com/api/featuredcategories/?cc=<CC>&l=english` — `specials`,
 *    `new_releases`, `top_sellers`, `coming_soon`, each a `{ items: [...] }` bag.
 *  - `store.steampowered.com/api/storesearch/?term=…&cc=<CC>` — the same endpoint
 *    [SteamStoreSearch.searchByName] already uses, read here for its `price` block too.
 *
 * Because they are undocumented they are treated as *decoration*, never as load-bearing data:
 * every call is best-effort, returns null / an empty list on any failure, and NEVER throws. The
 * Store tab is required to stay usable (retry affordance, Library still one tap away) when this
 * returns nothing — see `SteamStoreTab`.
 *
 * Region: `cc` comes from [SteamRegion.storeCountryCode] so prices are in the account's currency.
 * Results are cached in-process per `cc` for [FEATURED_TTL_MS] (rails) / [SEARCH_TTL_MS] (queries),
 * so tab switches, rotation and back-navigation never re-hit the network.
 *
 * House HTTP style: [SteamStoreSearch.httpGet] (plain HttpURLConnection + org.json, no new deps).
 * Every method is a `suspend` that hops to [Dispatchers.IO] itself, so callers stay non-blocking.
