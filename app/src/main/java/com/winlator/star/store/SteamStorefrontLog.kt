/**
 * Diagnostic logging for the Steam storefront (Store / Library / Friends / Profile).
 *
 * The storefront leans on two things that are neither documented nor device-proven — Steam's
 * undocumented `store.steampowered.com/api/` endpoints and the engine's brand-new player-profile
 * and free-license natives — so a blank tab must always leave a trail saying *which* of them gave
 * up. Everything here is failure-first: every network miss, every native returning null, and every
 * empty/error state a user can actually see gets a line.
 *
 * **One prefix, many areas.** Every tag starts with `SteamUI.` so a single on-device filter
 * captures the whole storefront in one stream:
 *
 * ```
 * adb logcat -v time | grep -F 'SteamUI.'
 * ```
 *
 * **Redaction.** Every message goes through [SteamLogRedactor.redact], which strips the registered
 * account name and refresh token plus any e-mail / JWT / long-token / full-SteamID64 pattern — this
 * log is meant to be shared. SteamIDs are deliberately logged through [sid] instead: the last five
 * digits correlate lines within a session without identifying the account, and survive redaction
 * (the redactor's SteamID64 rule only matches a full 17-digit run).
 *
 * **Cheap.** Nothing here is called per frame or inside a recomposition hot path — only on state
 * transitions, network completions and failures.
