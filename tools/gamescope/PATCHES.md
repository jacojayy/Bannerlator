# gamescope patches carried by the app

Built by `.github/workflows/build-gamescope.yml` on top of the exact gamescope the Linux runtime
ships (3.16.29, Arch Linux ARM's package, same build options), and staged from the apk over
`/usr/local/bin/gamescope` at each session start - the hosted runtime image is never touched.
The binary's shared-library needs are checked against `runtime-sonames.txt`, the runtime's own
library list, before anything is published.

- `0002-steamcompmgr-fallback-appid-focus.patch` - Armada (armada-os/armada), verbatim.
- `0009-fix-arm64-steam-night-mode.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the ARM64 client packs the
  night-mode property differently; the slider did nothing.
- `0019-steamcompmgr-arm64-virtual-white.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the colour-temperature
  slider's (x, y) arrives as one 64-bit element from the ARM64 client; y is recovered from x.
- `0020-color-p3-red-is-wide-gamut.patch` - Armada, verbatim.
- `0100-realtime-queue-and-gamepad-cursor.patch` - this app, two of Armada's ported by hand onto
  3.16.29: realtime-priority Vulkan queues on request (`GAMESCOPE_FORCE_VULKAN_REALTIME=1`)
  without CAP_SYS_NICE, which proot can never have; and the gamepad-driven cursor sprite following
  the X pointer that XTest moves (it sat frozen).

Sixteen more of Armada's patches are DRM/lease/HDR-on-KMS work for a native display, which this
app's Wayland-hosted gamescope never reaches, or need a newer gamescope than the runtime has.

## Where the published copy lives

The apk build fetches the archive named in `release.env` from **The412Banner/winlator-contents**, next to the Linux runtime it belongs to, and checks its sha256 before packing it in.
The copy there is SteamDeck's own `gamescope-3.16.29-p1` build, moved unchanged, so both apps share one file.
It is a pre-release that is never marked Latest, and it is not part of the runtime download (`linuxfs-r9` is untouched).
`build-gamescope.yml` here builds the same recipe on every change to `tools/gamescope`; to replace the published copy, build it, upload the result to winlator-contents as a new tag, and update `release.env`.
